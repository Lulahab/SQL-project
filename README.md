# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to load, clean, transform, and analyze data using SQL to gain valuable business insights. Specifically, this project aimed to answer both predefined questions and self-formulated ones to assess data trends and performance metrics.

## Process
### step 1:Data Loading
Data Source: CSV files
Method: Used the COPY command in PostgreSQL to load the data into the database.


### step 2:Step 2: Data Cleaning
Initial Checks: Identified missing and inconsistent data using basic SQL queries,checked for duplicates,null
Cleaning Actions:
replaced null values with 0 whenever necessary,
cast data type into desired datatype
Adjusted negative quantity values to 0 to ensure data accuracy.


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
Data Quality: Encountered missing and negative values that required cleaning.

## Future Goals
 Implement strategies to populate NULL values and missing data by calculating averages or using data from related tables to fill gaps. 
Further Analysis:  Explore predictive modeling to forecast future trends.
