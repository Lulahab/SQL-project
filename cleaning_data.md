What issues will you address by cleaning the data?

-remove duplicates
--standardize data;find issues in the data and fix it:inconsistent data formats,capitalization,
--null or blank value,try to populate or remove if no use

cleaning process:
-- Select distinct rows based on the `fullvisitorid` and other columns for a comprehensive view of each visitor's session
```sql
create view as
select distinct fullvisitorid , ---- Unique identifier for each visitor
       trim(both from INITCAP (channelgrouping)) AS channelgrouping, -- -- Format the `channelgrouping` column by trimming ----whitespace and capitalizing the first letter of each word
	   (time * interval'1 second')::time as time, ---- Convert the `time` column from seconds to a time format
	   lower(country) as country, ---- Convert the `country` and `city` columns to lowercase for consistency
	   lower(city) as city,
	   coalesce(totaltransactionrevenue,0) as totaltransactionrevenue, -- -- Replace NULL values in totaltransactionrevenue` with 0
	    coalesce(transactions,0) as transactions,
		timeonsite,
		coalesce(pageviews,0) as pageviews,
		coalesce(sessionqualitydim,0) as sessionqualitydim ,
		 to_date(date ::text,'yyyymmdd') AS date, -- -- Convert the `date` column (assumed to be in 'yyyymmdd' format) to a date type
		 visitid,
		 type,
		 coalesce(productrefundamount,0) as productrefundamount,
		 productquantity,
		 productprice/1000000 as productprice, ---- Divide `productprice` by 1,000,000 to convert from micros to standard currency format
		 coalesce(productrevenue,0),
		 trim(both from  (productsku)) as productsku,
		 trim(both from INITCAP (v2productname)) as productname,
		 trim(both from INTICAP (v2productcategory)) as v2productcategory,
		 trim(both from (productvariant)) as productvariant,
		 UPPER(currencycode) as currencycode,
		 coalesce(itemquantity,0) as itemquantity,
		 coalesce(itemrevenue,0) as itemrevenue,
		 coalesce(transactionrevenue,0) as transactionrevenue,
		 transactionid,
		 trim(both from (pagetitle)) as pagetitle,
		 searchkeyword,
		 trim(both from (pagepathlevel1)) as pagepathlevel1,
		 ecommerceaction_type,
		 ecommerceaction_step,
		 ecommerceaction_option
from all_sessions

```


Explanation:
--SELECT DISTINCT: Ensures each row in the result is unique based on the selected columns.
--TRIM, INITCAP, LOWER, UPPER: Used for formatting string data to remove extra spaces, standardize capitalization, and ensure uniform text representation.
--COALESCE: Replaces NULL values with 0 to avoid issues with calculations and present complete data.
--(time * interval '1 second')::time: Converts the time field (assumed to be in seconds) to a time format.
--TO_DATE: Converts a date stored as a string in the 'yyyymmdd' format to a proper DATE type.
This query provides a comprehensive view of all_session data with clean and consistent formatting.




```sql
select*from analytics

create view as cleaned_analytics
select distinct
     visitnumber,
     visitid, 
     ((interval'1 second') * visitstarttime::integer)::time  as visitstarttime,---- Converts visitstarttime (in seconds) to a TIME data type
     to_date(date::text, 'yyyymmdd')::date as date,
     fullvisitorid,
     trim(both from INITCAP (channelgrouping)) AS channelgrouping,
     socialengagementtype,
     coalesce(units_sold,0) as units_sold,
     coalesce(pageviews::integer,0) as pageviews,
     '00:00:00'::time  as timeonsite,
     coalesce(bounces, 0) as bounces,
     coalesce(revenue, 0) as revenue,
     (unit_price/1000000) as unit_price
from analytics
     ```

1. Cleaning and Formatting Data: It creates a new view (cleaned_analytics) from the analytics table, transforming certain fields for clarity and consistency. It formats the visitstarttime field to a TIME type and converts the date field into a standard DATE format.

2.Trimming and Normalizing Values: The channelgrouping is trimmed of extra spaces and capitalized using INITCAP to ensure uniform formatting.

3.Handling Null Values: The query uses COALESCE to replace NULL values in several columns (units_sold, pageviews, bounces, revenue) with zero, ensuring no missing data.

4.Calculating Unit Price: The unit_price is divided by 1,000,000 for scaling, adjusting the values to the intended range for analysis.

This cleaned and transformed dataset is ready for further analysis or visualization.
