-- Select distinct rows based on the `fullvisitorid` and other columns for a comprehensive view of each visitor's session

create view as
select distinct fullvisitorid , ---- Unique identifier for each visitor
       trim(both from INITCAP (channelgrouping)) AS channelgrouping, -- -- Format the `channelgrouping` column by trimming ----whitespace and capitalizing the first letter of each word
	   (time * interval'1 second')::time as time, ---- Convert the `time` column from seconds to a time format
	   lower(country) as country, ---- Convert the `country` and `city` columns to lowercase for consistency
	   lower(city) as city,
	   coalesce(totaltransactionrevenue,0) as totaltransactionrevenue, -- -- Replace NULL values in totaltransactionrevenue` with 0
	    coalesce(transactions,0) as transactions,
		timeonsite,
		coalesce(pageviews,0) as pageviews,
		coalesce(sessionqualitydim,0) as sessionqualitydim ,

Explanation:
--SELECT DISTINCT: Ensures each row in the result is unique based on the selected columns.
--TRIM, INITCAP, LOWER, UPPER: Used for formatting string data to remove extra spaces, standardize capitalization, and ensure uniform text representation.
--COALESCE: Replaces NULL values with 0 to avoid issues with calculations and present complete data.
--(time * interval '1 second')::time: Converts the time field (assumed to be in seconds) to a time format.
--TO_DATE: Converts a date stored as a string in the 'yyyymmdd' format to a proper DATE type.
This query provides a comprehensive view of all_session data with clean and consistent formatting.
